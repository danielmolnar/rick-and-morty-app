# Rick and Morty

This [app](https://rick-and-morty-app-iota.vercel.app/) was part of the teaching program at the coding bootcamp I visited. It was conducted as a team project with each team consisting of 3-4 students. The main requirement was to fetch data from an external api in order to render cards for each character. Furthermore, we implemented features we just recently learned including React Router, LocalStorage, propTypes and StyleGuidist.
